# LINKS

* [Operating Systems - Sistem Operasi](https://os.vlsm.org/) ---
Main source for your learning in class.
Materials such as slides, assignments, useful links, and demos are here.
The link is interesting because it has been used since a long time ago.
* [Geeks for Geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/) ---
Your go-to forum page if you encounter any problem.
The link is interesting because I can search linux commands, github how-to, and so on.
* [YouTube](https://youtu.be/U_P23SqJaDc) ---
Intro to Cyber Security Course.
Very detailed explanation and beginner friendly.
* [Slides](https://www.os-book.com/OS10/slide-dir/) ---

Recommended if you prefer to read only important points and not the whole book.
* [Make Tech Easier](https://www.maketecheasier.com/copy-paste-files-linux-command-line/) ---
