# LINKS

* [Operating Systems - Sistem Operasi](https://os.vlsm.org/) ---
Main source for your learning in class.
Materials such as slides, assignments, useful links, and demos are here.
The link is interesting because it has been used since a long time ago.
* [Geeks for Geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/) ---
Your go-to forum page if you encounter any problem.
The link is interesting because I can search linux commands, github how-to, and so on.
